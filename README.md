## Quick Start

## Installation

Hours is written in PHP. You will need a PHP version >= 7.2. You can check this easily with the `php --version` command. If you don't have PHP installed follow the [full installation guide](https://matt-allan.github.io/hours/user-guide/installation/).

Once you have PHP installation you can easily download the executable from Github:

```
wget https://github.com/matt-allan/hours/releases/latest/download/hours -O hours
chmod a+x ./hours
mv ./hours /usr/local/bin/hours
```

## Usage

To begin tracking time use the `start` command. You can specify the name of the project to track time for, as well as any tags or notes you would like to add.

```
$ hours start blog --tag writing --notes 'Updating the about page'
Starting frame for blog (writing) at 12:26 pm
```

This will create a "frame". Once you have finished your task you can stop tracking time with the `stop` command.

```
$ hours stop                                                      
Time tracking for blog stopped (started 1 hour ago).
```

You can view all of your frames with the `report` command.

```
$ hours report                                      
May 1, 2019 to May 7, 2019
