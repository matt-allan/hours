## Quick Start

## Installation

Hours is written in PHP. You will need a PHP version >= 7.1.3. You can check this easily with the `php --version` command.

If you have PHP installation you can easily download the executable from Github:

```
wget https://github.com/matt-allan/hours/releases/download/0.1.0/hours -O hours
sudo chmod a+x hours
sudo mv hours /usr/local/bin/hours
```

## Usage

To begin tracking time use the `start` command. You can specify the name of the project to track time for, as well as any tags or notes you would like to add.

```
$ hours start blog --tag writing --notes 'Updating the about page'
Starting frame for blog (writing) at 12:26 pm
```

This will create a "frame". Once you have finished your task you can stop tracking time with the `stop` command.

```console
$ hours stop                                                      
Time tracking for blog stopped (started 1 hour ago).
```

You can view all of your frames with the `report` command.

```console
$ hours report
