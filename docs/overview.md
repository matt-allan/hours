# Overview

Hours is a minimal command line application for tracking time. The CLI makes it easy to track the amount of time you spend on different tasks. Afterwards you can generate beautiful reports that let you know where your time is going.

Hours is similar to services like [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com) and [Toggl](https://toggl.com) except everything is done through the terminal instead of a web browser, it's completely free and open source, and your data never leaves your computer.

If you are looking to get started tracking time check out the [user guide](./user-guide). If you are a developer looking to contribute check out the [contibutor guide](./contributing/).
